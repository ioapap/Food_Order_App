<h1>Food Order App 🍔</h1>
<p>This is a simple food order app that was built as a practice project to reinforce key concepts and aspects of web development. The app allows users to choose from a list of meals 🍲 and add them to a cart 🛒. They can change the quantities and add multiple items. The app also features a basic checkout form where the user can submit their order.

Before submitting the order, the user input is validated on the client side to ensure data accuracy. Once validated, the order data is then submitted to a backend server using an HTTP request 🌐. Firebase 🔥 is used as the dummy backend server for this project.

The app also fetches meal data from the backend server, allowing users to select from a list of available meals 🍴.

It was a practical exercise to practice all the previous concepts learned in the React course, diving into the essence of each section and reinforcing core web development concepts 🧑‍💻.</p>
